# Employee-Attrition

In today’s fast-paced corporate world, one of the main problems of the modern highly competitive business environment is employee turnover. Not only they lose out on talented employees but it also leads to high costs in recruitment, training and productivity losses. This research will work towards offering some of the possible causes that organisations may need to know in their bid to tackle the issue of attrition and respond appropriately to ensure they retain their employees. We explored IBM’s employee attrition dataset to find the underlying factors that contribute to employee turnover and by using ML models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost. We aim to predict the key features that influence this phenomenon.

The results show that, XGBoost performs better than the other models in terms of both accuracy and ROC-AUC score, showcasing it’s better ability to distinguish between employees who will leave and those who will stay. Random Forest performs decently followed by Logistic Regression which has the lowest scores, which indicates it may not capture the non-linear relationships as effectively as the ensemble methods.
